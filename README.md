# DSN Hackathon Project
This is my project notebook for the Data Science Nigeria (DSN) Hackathon.

What's in this project?
This Jupyter Notebook (DSN_HACKATHON_PROJECT.ipynb) contains the code and analysis I worked on for the hackathon. It includes the steps I took to explore the data, build models, and generate insights for the competition.

How to Use
You can view the notebook directly here on GitHub by clicking on the DSN_HACKATHON_PROJECT.ipynb file above.

To run it yourself, you'll need a Python environment with data science libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn installed.

You can clone this repository to your local machine to experiment with the code.

About
This project was created as part of my learning journey in data science and machine learning.

Thank you.
